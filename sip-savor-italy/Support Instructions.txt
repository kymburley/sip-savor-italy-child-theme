Thank you so much for purchasing one of our themes!   It is an honor that you chose one of our designs to represent you and your online brand.   I'm excited to see how you customize the theme and look forward to sharing it on our Showcase page, if you would like.  

You can access the theme setup page by going to this link.

The demo .XML and .WIE files are stored in the XML folder in your theme zip.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any issues setting up your new theme.   To access the Wordpress Video Tutorials you will need to create an account on the site.  If you would like to do that, please navigate to

and fill out the form for creating a user name.  While I try to create user accounts as fast as possible, do allow up to 48 hours for this to be done.  If you have any issues setting up your new theme, please contact me.  Would love to help anyway I can.  Also don't forget to submit your site when finished so I can share it across social networking and in the Showcase.


Thank you,
Jennifer
